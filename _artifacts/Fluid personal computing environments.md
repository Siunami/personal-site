Environments can be constructed in a compositional way

- Want to make a music player where I can take a picture or send a PDF of a sheet music. It automatically splits it into parts. And lets me toggle parts on and off. Play along with the track. Count in to a particular line.

Their physical spaces "are messy, informal, mixed together, freeform, and personal." - Muse

These spaces evolve over time as the needs of the individual change.

**People's physical spaces have so much variety.** From the structural form and shape, to the arrangement of objects inside it. They're a living snapshot of a dynamic feedback loop between the individual and the space.

Creative spaces are particularly dynamic. They're "messy, informal, mixed together, freeform, and personal".

**Digital spaces often look so similar.** The objects may be different, but everyone uses the same applications. These applications, while attempting to anticipate a wide variety of needs, exact a high degree of conformity in the objects produced in that environment. Every piece of software is opinionated. The choices a designer makes affect how easy it is to take certain actions, influencing the individual's behavior.

An anecdote I heard second hand: one of the executive's at Autodesk could walk through a city and point out which version of Autodesk was used for a particular building.

If an individual wishes to shape an application to fit their needs better, it either can't be done, or only in the ways that application allows. The other option is to build their own application. However, this has multiple challenges.

**Software is slow, complex and expensive to build.** This makes it difficult for an individual to create software themselves, instead relying on the expertise of others who design general purpose solutions over specific ones, tailored to the individual's needs.

**Data lock-in creates friction to try new tools.** Even if a better solution exists, moving everything over to a new environment makes it easy to stick with a solution that somewhat works.
