## developing competence

Reminds me of a point that Tyler Cowen made in his [Tetragrammaton appearance](https://pca.st/5yk8fc5l) (starting at timestamp 8:50). That today, hardware and software are becoming the same thing; countries will need competence in both in order to succeed in the future. Self-driving vehicles, drones, FPGA chips{% sidenote 1 'An FPGA is a blank slate composed simply of a vast array of transistor logic elements and switches capable of being interconnected via a dense metal wiring stack. via [Pushkar Ranade](https://medium.com/@magicsilicon?source=post_page-----a899d343644--------------------------------)'%}, mobile devices, embedded systems.

It would do any country well to encourage the individuals willing to try. There will be lots of setbacks and learnings. Many flops. Not that different from building pure software applications. This is how we will build future capabilities and know-how.


## interfaces are a map, not the territory

> "Steve Jobs supposedly claimed that he intended his personal computer to be a¬†*bicycle for the mind*¬†‚Äî But what he really sold us was a¬†*train for the mind*, which goes only between where rails and stations have been laid down by armies of laborers." - via [Devine Lu Linvega](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/stack.html)

Interfaces make certain capabilities in a technology legible. However, the full set of capabilities is always much more expansive. I think many interaction designers and technologists in computing today sense this. Interfaces are a map, not the territory{% sidenote 2 'Polish-American scientist and philosopher¬†[Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski "Alfred Korzybski")¬†remarked that "the map is not the territory" and that "the word is not the thing", encapsulating his view that an¬†abstraction¬†derived from something, or a reaction to it, is not the thing itself. - via [Map-territory relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation)'%}. Behind the scenes, someone has made decisions on our behalf about how we will access these capabilities, like a system of rails and stations deciding what places we are able to visit.

It's in a place's details, its people, its sounds, its smells, its sights, that I feel like I understand it. As I walk, I weave my own map of the place.

The way I approach interaction design feels similar. First explore and notice the details in the systems I am designing for, understand what is possible in a raw capabilities sense, consider what capabilities resonate for me and how to weave an experience that brings these capabilities together.

## pattern language of creative exercises

I like that the author pokes holes in what looks like the US military's definitions of a cruise missile. And does so in this methodical way. 

This last year, I've learned how important good definitions are. And how various definitions of a problem statement, question, term, or phrase can take you down very different paths of thought. Charts like the above are one way to explore the implications of certain phrasings. There are many more.

I find myself wanting to gather a collection of these methods in a single place as reference. A sort of Pattern Language{% sidenote 6 'After the publishing of [a book](https://www.patternlanguage.com/) with this title, many people inspired by it have curated their own collection of patterns on various topics.

Perhaps this can be a fun collaboration with people.

## habit formation is about momentum

My friend [Max](https://twitter.com/maxkriegers) released a new social app that I've been using recently. I had a nice little streak going until I missed one day. It felt pretty demoralizing to restart and so I ended up missing two more days after that.

It made me think about the purpose of streaks in apps. If the goal is to help with habit formation, then it's ok to miss a day every now and then while still making good progress. However, when you break a streak and are reset to 0, it feels unforgiving. A penalty that's too strong for a small transgression.

I'm curious about a habit tracking mechanism that takes into account momentum. For example, if you miss a day after a 90 day streak, you might take a small ding to your current momentum score. But overall, you're score is still up. It's only when you miss multiple days in a row that it starts to noticeably go down. When it comes to forming new habits, I'm of the belief that it's missing multiple days that you want to avoid rather than a single day.

Or even simpler. A counter that increments up each time you do the activity.
