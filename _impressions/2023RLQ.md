_Questions have a alluring quality to them. Each one is like an invitation. A call to adventure. As an end of year reflection, I pulled out every question (lightly curated) that I wrote in my notes. Reading through it reminded me of the [emotional and intellectual forces](https://michaelnotebook.com/creative_context/index.html) that drove my work this year–many still alive in me now. I'm sharing them here in case they spark something for you too._

First impression, what was interesting to you and why did you add it?

What questions might be answered by reading it that are relevant to our work?

Can you help someone get from where they are to new territory?

Interaction design is as much about connecting humans across the murky “Internet cloud” (fostering community and conversation) as connecting an individual with his or her own capacity to explore what is possible and generate new possibilities (**supporting internal conversations**).” Hugh Dubberly in [What is Conversation?

Once you’ve narrowed to one persona, we can get more specific about their scenarios and try to identify more clearly: what does a theme mean to this person?

What kinds of operations do they need to perform on a theme?

How do those operations relate to their broader context?

One thing that seems to be missing from all these scenarios is: “then what?” How does the activity you’re describing (manipulating notes and themes) actually connect to the broader goals and behaviors you articulated?

For instance, what (if any) behavioral/cognitive theory will underpin our design ideas given this new problem/scenario?

Klein’s sensemaking framework is still partially relevant, but not in the same ways… how does it fit in?

Can we articulate any other theoretical frameworks (possibly our own) that will inform our design besides intuition and user testing?

How does that feel to you?

If we design primarily for this persona, will we be able to appropriately evaluate design ideas ourselves?

Maybe you’re thinking that the analogue in our context is us getting each other unstuck in this project?

Does that roughly match what you’re thinking?

Of course helping with communication will be great, too, but it seems like step two?

Would changing their supplier allow them to get around some of the tradeoffs?

How does that fit into the scenario you imagine?

Are there other “multiplayer” elements that interact with the system here, apart from using the system to construct some kind of distilled/structured summary to send others?

In what ways?

What has been mentioned/explored/discussed so far?

What is the big picture?

Missing?

What problem is this solving exactly?

What is the nature of the problem?

How can all the chaff be used constructively to make the new thing?

What is hard about using all the working material as fodder for progress?

Is there a suite of mechanisms like this, or is this the best one?

How does this mechanism relate to the problem statement?

What are the facets of the paragraph being emphasized?

Can semantic search be valuable for highly unstructured text corpora?

What is the mechanism that's being shown here?

What is the reason for using this conceptual design?

What problem is the conceptual design solving?

How can semantic search be improved for better generation results?

What is the value of semantic search for unstructured text corpora?

How can the mechanism be tied to the experience in Japan?

What is the problem that the conceptual design is designed to solve?

What are the implications of the conceptual design for changing the problem?

How long is the current runway for the project?

What opportunities may arise as a result of the project?

What will happen in the next year based on the project's progress?

What are some potential future directions for the project?

What is the essence of the problem statement being addressed?

How can the mechanism be made more userfriendly?

One way to test a problem statement is to step back and ask: does this seem to actually match the sorts of design ideas you find yourself interested in generating?

And: would this problem, if solved, be the thing your persona really needs?

What is that something?

What does he need to be able to do to solve his problem with those materials?

“Review and remix”?

But it seems to me that this problem statement would also authorize a completely different direction focused on, say, semantic search—wouldn’t that help make the material “accessible” for “review”?

How should we decide whether these two ideas or the themedistillation idea is the right path?

What is that something?

What does he need to be able to do to solve his problem with those materials?

Reconnect with the emotional and intellectual force that drove the production of those materials?

Are they still salient now?

What was most salient to him at that time and past context?

What is still salient from that past context?

What will form will recreate the most vivid mental image of a past activity?

what do you need to do when looking at this material?

materials produced/gathered that may be relevant on multiple time scales, losing emotional connection to work; What were the things that invigorated the work initially?

How does it feel to use this?

How similar do you want the sequence of prompts to be?

Love, wisdom, grace, inspiration — how do you go about finding these things that are in some ways about extending the boundaries of the self into unknown territory, about becoming someone else?

What form will recreate the most vivid mental image of a past activity?

When you’re in a situation, what will you use?

How malleable are these dispositions?

How to push this further this week?

How to balance push and pull?

How do we show learning?

Having progress indicators that counterbalance each other?

Quote 2: "So then, I guess the question that I need to explore a little bit more with Andy this week is like wha is the purpose of memory?

How would tove jansson (propn) use (v) spaced repetition (n)?

Maybe it would be interesting to have a little conversation about a prompt, as an exercise?

What are some powerful visions of computing from the past?

What did they do well and where did they struggle?

how do you enable talent to do the things they want to do?

Asked, what would happen if in ten years you were told to stop using the device?

A reflection/memory/creativity support system that in ten years, would be something people would be unwilling to put down?

What would it look like?

What does the space of information visualizations look like?

How can we develop a meaningful human augmentation laboratory?

How can we develop transformative tools for thought?

How did the computer animation industry get started; was it public research?

Seems like Pixar was able to build on their work?

Perhaps progress can measured by the rate which new fields are created?

What role does emotion play in memory and cognition?

If spaced repetition were different genres of video game, how would you play?

What does it take to become an expert in Chess?

What are the differences between a novice and an expert in a field?

What happened in that minute of time?

What things did they pay attention to, what cues and signals helped them arrive at that answer?

And is it possible to externalize and teach those cues to novices?

Programmable attention?

Expanding the variety of prompts that people can get in a spaced repetition system?

What happens when people design or are prompted with questions that come from these categories?

Helping people navigate the messy middle of a creative project by remixing materials (concepts?

So is this is this is this process useful?

How do people do this process today?

tools for thought how do we amplify and support human intelligence and understanding?

concepts are really powerful, like, what other strategies does Taiwan have access to?

Why does a chair look like this?

Why do we have these particular tools?

Why is a T shirt printed with the things that it has on it?

What is it communicating?

What is it saying about this world?

And then you're asking yourself, How do I feel about this?

Like, what does it does it does it adequately solve or like communicate the thing that I'm trying to say?

Or is there a clear way to say the thing I want to say that doesn't exist already?

We need experience to validate the components of a concept how do you know what a profit generating home looks like?

Does anyone else experienced this?

Am I alone?

And are we together in this industry experience that we call life which?

What are some of the hard parts of developing a concept?

What comes to mind?

And so how do we support the human in this process?

And so how do we support the human solving problems?

How do we support the human working on complex situations?

What are the hard parts about creating concepts?

What does it take to develop a concept or an abstraction?

Why?

Why?

Why?

And so, how do we discover these patterns?

And we need to enrich it first we need to win first we need to deconstruct it we need to understand the pieces of reality like when this conversation with as I'm speaking what are the things that I said what are the raw things are the things that are important?

The RE mixing problem and helping us juggle concepts up today, and yeah, I guess this is an open question of what is the unit of knowledge that is important to work with?

What do I want to do with references?

How have people done online references in the past?

Is there some way to evaluate the quality of an abstraction/waypoint?

for example, the amount of hierarchical nesting?

How have people designed pivot systems in the past?

Can we discover and explain highlevel patterns?

Do they generate insights that guide our design?

Do they spark ideas?

Do they lead to great systems?

Does it make sense to have all these sorts of views that you can select from?

What is the commonality between these things?

But if we are able to choose where this comes from, from a place we have deemed meaningful, how lucky are we?

Can you understand different cultures by how their understanding of various concepts differ?

Why do we need concepts and how do we use them?

Similar how?

When do we need concepts?

Why do I think figuring out what to do next can be described as a concept problem?

Why is this concept important to me?

What do I know about this concept?

What do I want to know about this concept?

Why did I start thinking about this concepts stuff?

What was the point?

What is the current problem statement?

Why is this concept important to me?

What do I know about this concept?

What do I want to know about this concept?

How does this affect what I’m doing?

Why is a concept important to me?

At some point, you’re like why did I start reading in the first place?

Did I finish it he gathering or do I still have more to do?

Does research confirm this?

How long should students persist to find the answers?

Is this time efficiently spent?

Or, would it be better to have the students try to answer a few questions, pool their information as a class, and then move to practicing retrieval of the information?

What are the important concepts from this conversation?

Ex: Why do we need concepts?

What is a context scenario?

How does the proposed system map to Klein and sensemaking?

What are the differences between Andy and my own conception of what it means to figure out what to do next?

What information do we keep and why do we keep it?

For example, “that’s interesting”, “tell me more”, “how did that make you feel”?

Do users want to make copies of highlights and out them in multiple places?

For example, “that’s interesting”, “tell me more”, “how did that make you feel”?

What set functions are most important?

For example, are they typically native or nonnative?

What about the type of bark?

What method do they use to reproduce?

Are they seed or fruit bearing?

How we can mix ideas together like chemical elements to produce new ones?

What is a block?

What ways can you reference text in other mediums?

What if there was something similar with interfaces, systematically reintroducing elements back?

Where can I learn more?

How do I want to convey my interests, work and past experiences?

My sense is that we’ve gestured at some possiblygeneral powerful ideas “explainable” LLMbased summarization can augment frame formation?

Naively, I wonder: is there some version of this idea that you _would_ be more familiar with?

Or, relatedly, why are you personally so excited about these directions in the first place?

Isn’t it because (even before this project) you’ve found yourself in situations where something like it would be needed?

Can you draw on those situations?

Relatedly, I also wonder if extracting signal from interview or conversation transcripts might feel more familiar to you than your logbook?

Then at the moment that you’ve identified a salient reframe, how quickly can you assemble that frame from the existing material?

why are you personally so excited about these directions in the first place?

Framing these beliefs as a question, how can we develop more reflective mediums for wayfinding?

why are you personally so excited about these directions in the first place?

Posed as a question, how can we develop powerful, new mediums for wayfinding?

how can we develop powerful, new mediums for wayfinding?

I find it funny that I can write something with such a high level of conviction, only to look at it later and ask, was that really what mattered?

how can we develop powerful, new mediums for wayfinding?

Posed as a question, how can we develop powerful, new mediums for wayfinding?

Is there a connection to life as improv?

What problem am I solving for?

What’s so great about the digital medium anyway?

to what extent is achieving that goal about learning to write better prompts?

Are individual prompts the best primitives for that task?

If we step back and look at what’s actually necessary to produce that sort of understanding, and at the mechanisms of practice, could we find a bettermatched primitive?

Reframing “memory systems” as “practice systems” for a moment, is there some other kind of primitive waiting to be created—one which would let me “add the concept” as an elementary operation, in the same way I can “add a vocabulary word” to one of today’s memory systems?

What does it mean to “add a concept”?

What specifically would you be adding?

What is research?

What other verbs could be useful for [nonmemory prompts](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Unusual_applications_of_spaced_repetition_memory_systems) like these?

However, perhaps it’s worth another look?

What is the problem with working with these brain dumps?

Grab all the salient items, put them in one place, then ask what makes these things related?

what are they trying to tell me?

Ok so working memory, you’re feeling overwhelmed, why?

What was wrong about what he did here?

Are we saying could have done this faster?

Or easier?

Or better?

Layer: Interface?

And then if someone asks how come?

What is the challenge with making these handles?

How do we make those handles today?

Why do we need handles?

For example I have a section called what is the problem with working with these brain dumps?

What do concepts do for you?

Which ones have the most use across contexts?

Why was this relevant?

Why do we develop them?

An open question, is how do abstract concepts develop?

What are the challenges with developing concepts?

Is it getting them socially agreed upon?

What words are real and what aren’t?

Are these words real, really asking how many brains will this give me access to?

Is language the ultimate artefact?

What exactly are the unaided cognitive capacities of the human brain?

We have this dense mess of text and we want to ask ourselves what was important?

How do we know what to care about?

But what does it say?

What is the challenge with making these handles?

Why do we create abstractions?

How do we develop abstractions?

What is important to consider?

What was the one thing that shifted today?

So where have I been getting stuck?

What was the problem that it solves for?

Why do people take the action?

What is the artifact we’re trying to create?

Can we discover and explain highlevel patterns?

Do they generate insights that guide our design?

Do they spark ideas?

Do they lead to great systems?

Why?

How?

What do I know about pivots?

What makes them so useful?

What do I want to know more about them?

Why is this pattern powerful?

What implications does this have on my goal if it’s true?

So is the goal to invent new definitions?

New words to put in some local dictionary?

Or inventing new definitions for words to be used in some specific context that emphasizes different things?

Or new phrases?

What do they share in common?

For example, ok what seems emotionally important from what I’m saying today?

Ok, why do I feel like that?

Ok great, what do I know about pivots?

What would help me implement these better?

Why might pivots not work?

Now why is it interesting?

Like are they going somewhere?

Importance scale why do I care about this concept?

Why do I feel this concept is important?

Why might this concept not be important?

What do I know about this concept?

What do I want to know about this concept?

What are you pivoting on?

Why might this concept not be important?

What other moves should I make?

Why do we create abstractions?

What type of abstractions do I find myself creating?

What is difficult about creating abstractions?

What is the problem with working with these brain dumps?

Grab all the salient items, put them in one place, then ask what makes these things related?

what are they trying to tell me?

Layer: Interface?

I think you can probably help yourself by sharpening up “dealing with large quantities of nove information.” What does “dealing with” mean here?

Are they generating the information?

Collecting it from other people?

How does this first sentence connect to the personal, reflective, emotional emphasis you’ve been chasing for the past couple weeks?

Is it too broad to say both generating and collecting?

Are we focused on researchers here?

And for intellectual purposes, like you’re describing, rather than personal emotional ones?

I’d suggest we maybe spend an hour tightening it up in realtime?

Would you be game to meet after the call with Dan tomorrow?

Is it too broad to say both generating and collecting in regards to researcher dealing with information?

is there anything specific I do that is particularly effective or you’ve seen elsewhere?

What do I ultimately want to achieve?

Could we just move forward and develop this technique for ourselves?

Then see where other people choose to use it?

What type of paper do I imagine?

Not sure how I can do this if it goes against his beliefs in LLMs?

But are there potentially more powerful memory techniques that we can leverage?

Ones that people might not use as much today because they are time intensive and difficult to do?

Given the computer’s ability to process information, can we use it to help us create these powerful artifacts?

Working memory and cognitive load are insufficient, for what?

Why don’t current processes work?

Why do you need to notice clusters?

Is it too broad to say both generating and collecting in regards to researcher dealing with information?

Human computer symbiosis?

What would a game about exploring your mind look like?

What is the goal of such a game?

So what did you do today?

How did that connect to your goals?

Why?

One of the main ones being, what if I don't find anything powerful here?

What were the powerful phrases I was playing with?

What other things would I do if not this?

But for what?

Maybe I could work on something else?

To what degree will such systems promote behavior characterized by user control vs. more passive acceptance of algorithmic recommendations?

Can appropriate designs prompt more critical engagement in the face of automated support?

In some cases, should we accept having the computer “think for us,” if it frees us to engage in higherlevel reasoning or more creative practice?

Once we have these directions, there’s a very natural question to ask: which words are furthest in these directions?

What are the most masculine or feminine words?

The most adult, the most childish?

Hopefully you’ll produce a real increment, and you’ll build skills, and that’s great—but who’s going to do the next iteration?

How can we develop transformative tools for thought?

how can we develop tools that change and expand the range of thoughts human beings can think?

One of the most famous papers in the philosophy of consciousness is entitled “What is it like to be a bat?” Each tool for thought poses a similar question, near impossible to answer without immersion in the tool: “What is it like to be a language user?

So what?

Would that mean I shouldn’t do it?

How might one create *timeful texts*—texts with affordances extending the authored experience over weeks and months, texts which continue the conversation with the reader as they slowly integrate those ideas into their lives?

"tell the data’s story” Is the aim really to “tell the data’s story”?

Tell it for what purpose?

To whom?

Naively, given our chats the last couple of weeks, I think I’d have written “…features and patterns to figure out what to do next.” Was there a reason you moved from the “what to do next” framing we’d been discussing to “telling a story”?

We’ve been talking about it plenty in our conversations, but one of the next things this statement will need is: what is the point of this labeling, connecting, and categorizing?

the first sentence)?

What do people do with these labels, and why is it a problem that they get stuck?

What if instead of human versus machine we played as partners?

Can we find principles that will help us design more powerful humanmachine systems?

What's missing from Engelbart's paper?

Can we trust the computer’s ability to help us identify key parts of a text?

Will this just be eclipsed by machines in near future?

In order to.. what?

Feel safe?

Feel worthwhile?

Feel acknowledged?

Feel successful?

Feel fame?

What if you feel nothing?

How would that be?

What if you let go of who you thought you were, and figured out the truth?

What if what you thought about these emotions weren't the full picture?

Would that change everything?

Can you help me better understand Minsky's beliefs around the above concepts?

Can you build on your understanding of uniframing, accumulating, reformulating, and transframing and incorporate the above ideas (memory stuff) from Minsky into this framework?

Are there other ideas from Minsky that we can incorporate into our understanding above?

What parts does it cover and what parts does it not?

How do we deal with the complexity of information?

Unified theory?

How about other frames that Klein suggests like stories?

What is each more effective at goalswise?

What parts don’t fit?

Handling new evidence, how does it affect the models?

Because how could I waste a CEO's time with the sorts of petty projects I was working on?

And if that's the case, can we see the humanity in ourselves?

Can we love and see each other for what we are?

These complex beings living complex lives in a complex world with complex situations?

How much do I want to just introduce problems without a solution?

Why do you keep coming?

Or, in other words, how do you stop time and death?

What makes a life?

Roughly, what could I imagine the constraints to look like?

And if that’s the case, then can I allow myself to let this go for now?

Focus myself fully on the task of discovering what is possible?

What does that look like?

How can I shift my mindset from focusing on feature sets to truly embracing a researchdriven approach, seeking powerful ideas and solutions?

How can I let go of my preconceived notions about my future and stay open to radically different possibilities, while fully immersing myself in the present task and honing my skills, taste, and communication abilities?

How do we get to a really powerful explanation of what is happening?

How do we make sense of this?

How can we make this fun?

Throw this into ChatGPT, can you give me an outline?

Like how does one feel like they’ve made sense of a set of questions sufficiently enough to close the narrative?

I guess when the question feels answered?

And then what is the form of the final output?

My instinct would be to focus our conversation on this notion of representations: what kinds of immediate representations end up getting produced as they work and think?

Are they always aggregates/compressions, or are they sometimes something else?

How do the aggregates/compressions interact with “raw data”?

How do they end up using those representations to produce some “final product”?

Are there techniques that you use now that you didn’t use at the start?

But what is the unique lense or frame that he is bringing to the table?

Many ways you realize you have the outline the wrong way?

As a writer, when this person says they violated the agreement, are they saying the same things?

Trying to make an outline, how do you do it?

How do you do it?

Memorization and Piotr Wozniak, what did the psychologists tell use about memorization?

Do I find what I’m looking for or something different?

Can you pull out all the quotes from the text above that may be useful to this interest?

But is thinking actually that linear?

Why do I let these people have that type of power over me?

Is it because you value their opinion or because it touched on an insecurity?

What can you take away from this situation to help you become more resilient in the future?

Are penguins birds?

Is the pope a bachelor?

Why do we need concepts and how do we use them?

Ex: Why do we need concepts?

[00:00:11] Matt: in your wall?

How are you doing?

W were were, were there like a theme that you were sketching around together?

Cuz I, I can get all consumed to something, but like, I have to be very explicit about like, you know what, I should go and like not do anything for like the next like, Afternoon or whatever, right?

[00:02:50] Um, What, what is hard?

Like why is it so hard to get into an ingroup?

It's like, what's hard about that?

Uh, so, um, what, what would it be helpful to discuss?

Like more like linguistics type stuff around like what is the point of conceptual abstractions?

Um, starting with like, why do we even create these abstractions in the first place?

It's like, okay, so we've identified this pattern, uh, what are we gonna do about it next?

Or like, also, I guess this works for you with yourself over time, right?

[00:08:57] So, uh, for example, why does this concept feel important?

Why might this concept not be important, um, in reference to some sort of objective, like some goal, um, What do I know about this concept and what do I wanna know more about this concept?

So this next question, what type of abstractions do I find myself creating?

[00:12:58] I, I guess now I found myself wondering like, how is it different from a highlight?

Is a, is a waypoint like a, uh, range list highlight?

Of zero?

What is a pivot?

Um, yeah, I found, for example, one thing that I extracted from our conversation was, um, like, what is the problem with working with these brain dumps?

Uh, oh, you mean like the phrase is the abstraction here?

Like just keeping this in mind, like what is the problem?

Um, those, those are, those are like contexts, right?

What do you mean by angle?

Then, um, is it that we're trying to find one noun that captures all these things?

And one question I, I guess I remember asking last time, uh, on Monday was like, well, if this is a thing that people do already, um, how exactly is it that we imagine we're helping?

[00:25:00] Um, one thing I'm curious about, maybe if in your own experience, um, is it like, like arriving at these sort of clear like phrases or like terms, et cetera?

Like if, if you sort of like orient this writing process around that, is that, like, would that be something that maybe like is more of like an expert practice and if, if so, would that be something you would want an interface to nudge you towards?

But you asked, um, would it be helpful to have a piece of software to nudge me towards that?

To nudge me towards that?

I, I think we've, or, uh, on Monday I had with like, um, gathering sort of those candidate phrases of like, uh, at least yours, right?

Like, okay, like, are, are we doing this?

So I mean, I, I guess like on Monday you heard me recite like, okay, so we want to figure out like what is actually the problem we're solving in what context?

[00:30:39] Or like, why is it hard, uh, or like, uh, Uh, uh, what kind of moves can one make just conceptually, uh, in order to like, dig oneself out of this problem?

Um, what is like emotionally salient as I'm going through it?

I think possibly to an answer to a question I asked earlier in the conversation, which is like, what is it that we imagine we might be contributing here?

Like what did you do?

[00:38:01] What does it let you do?

How, how, how does it, how does it solve your, your problem?

Like I think you're saying you see this label like research logbook angle and you don't really know like, what does that mean?

What do I know about it and what do I wanna know more about?

[00:43:03] A highlights interface in PDF apps is usually, like, there's a list view where like all of the highlights are like listed in a table and you can like click one to navigate to it, you know?

Um, now you need to like look at those things you've extracted and try to figure out like what's next or like the so what or, um, like, uh, what, what are you, what are you gonna be able to do with this intellectually now that you've extracted all these things?

It's something to do with like the just like, uh, the spatiality, right?

[00:47:19] So do, like, why, why am I so mad about this?

Is that what you're asking?

Uh, why am I so mad about this?

But I mean, so like, I'm pasting these large chunks of text because if I highlight only like the, the most interesting part, then I will end up with even more garbage notes, right?

Like this was a book, right?

This is structured text, right?

Really?

[00:56:37] Does that feel better?

No, what's that?

Um, do, do you know this one?

What was that?

That is the nature of the problem, right?

[01:13:33] Matt: days?

For example, are they typically native or nonnative?

What about the type of bark?

What method do they use to reproduce?

Are they seed or fruit bearing?

how do we train people to come up with things that are completely new?

Why study history if history never repeats itself in Illstructured domains?

Why are the moomins so popular 70 years later?

20 years after her death?

DONE: Will start with this article and delve further if needed Is Speed Chess Good For You?

Why do we have memory systems like what what is memory for and what do we care about, right?

what type of change do I want my own lifestyle?

And I think a lot of people are trying to figure this out like, oh, what's the point?

I can add a title I can add like a status like what action like what have I done with it?

Tags basic stuff, impressions, like, what was my initial impression when I first added it to the table?

Why did I add it?

What was the thing the question etcetera, that I was hoping that this piece of content would answer for me, I found via table tab or column and this is just saying like, where did where did I find it on the internet?

Or how did I come become aware of it?

And I have to go through multiple passes of sort of writing and then like trying to extract like the key bullet points and like, okay, are these bullet points good?

Play around with the order?

You like there's a number of heuristics don't have orphan cards is one so you know, if you're going to just like get this one facts here, or this one other facts here for a narrative, maybe that's not something that would be very useful or effective to really try to memorize but the other bit too, is is this is is encoding this piece of information in my like memory, is it going to be useful?

For you know, is it going to stay five to 10 minutes in the future?

I guess one of those pieces of feedback that I'm sort of reflecting on now is, Who am I trying to write to?

And this light, this like device that like this night lamp that this company Casper had designed?

And I think in that you can see like almost like the love for people and that like these designers have when they're considering what what does this person's life look like and how can I design something to fit within their live their life and their lifestyle and their activity?

Zooming out what is the like kind of big point that I'm trying to make with this?

This piece?

And yeah, I guess this also kind of touches on like, Okay, so who is the audience like?

I'm writing I'm learning what is it kind of accumulating too?

Like I'm like, Why?

Why do we have memory systems like what what is memory for and what do we care about, right?

And so out of those things, like if I look at my own lifestyle, what type of behavior modification what type of change do I want my own lifestyle?

And I think if like me like yeah, change, I wanted my own lifestyle, but also how can computers and technology etc, and behavior changes kind of like support that?

And I think a lot of people are trying to figure this out like, oh, what's the point?

All this stuff right?

so then, I guess the question that I need to explore a little bit more with Andy this week is like what is the purpose of memory?

What is the purpose of memory systems like, what are we actually trying to get to?

But then from there, the question is, what type of experiments then?

And such Can you perform around these values and its desired possible end state?

What are the activities that we can do?

How does it feel to answer the same prompt over time?

How does asking follow up questions feel?

What about creativity?

Where do ideas come from?

So: can memory systems make us more insightful?

Presumably some kinds of prompts help here more than others—what characterizes that?

Are special synthesisoriented prompts helpful, or is the impact more a function of solidly understanding the basics?

If we designed a new “memory system” with the sole aim of downstream impact on creative work, what would it look like?

Would it involve retrieval practice at all?

So perhaps the question instead is what are the divergence activities?

How much has been connected or added to some container?

Can you see salience of an idea change over time?

Maybe overexposure to a stimulus leading to desensitization?

Can you compress the entire experience into a single fundamental action?

At least the main chunk of the flow?

Also, what if you actually blocked the user from constantly interacting with the app?

After you’ve done the narrative experience in the morning, you can’t do another until night time?

ex: is this still important to you?

Why has spaced repetition as a daily practice for myself been hard?

And what might this suggest about the challenges with it becoming a widespread practice?

How do you want to structure the Commons thing?

What are you hoping to get out of it?

What are you hoping to learn?

what is knowledge tracing?

what makes a question transformative?

How can we surface the right questions at the right time to people to promote positive growth and reflection?

When you’re in a situation, what will you use?

How malleable are these dispositions?

The critical thinking?

Experience?

how much familiarity is needed to approach the question?

How does performance on critical thinking tests transpose into performance in other activities?

How do you perform in a more naturalistic sense?

They go home and read a newspaper, do they actually behave differently?

Very unforgiving, you break a two week streak, what’s the point of studying anymore?

Can you keep the motivation pure?

Not create some proxy motivator for learning?

But they are compelling because they give us a very simple decision function: how do I know when I should do the thing or whether I’m doing the thing enough?

So what if there was this aspect in scheduling where the activities are assigned a level of time or energy?

What if you take partial habits and wrap them all inside of a daily habit?

Push and Pull, how do these things interplay?

How to push this further this week?

Maybe a spaced repetition card you know what?

How to balance push and pull?

How can you make a practice that not only helps you remember but helps you deepen your understanding over time?

what are you wanting to do with these prompts?

What do you find yourself wanting to see?

Why?

What else is not actually externalized very well?

Is it not ironic, I think, that I have sought isolation here in these remote mountains, only to become reliant on modern technology?

Turning to Sonam, I ask, 'Would you like me to teach you the basics of Thangka painting, dear traveler?

How is he faring now, and have our separate paths brought the spiritual impact we'd once hoped?

Is it time to seek him out, to join together in our mission once more?

I wonder what prompted my thoughts in this direction?

'How would I find him?

How could this note have found me here in my hermitage?

A thousand questions run through my mind how, indeed, did he leave the note for me?

Could his path have connected with mine without my knowing?

Overwhelmed by a mixture of disbelief and joy, I respond, 'Tenzin, is that really you?

'Tenzin, do you remember that cloudy night we secretly stargazed by the monastery, questioning the possibilities of other worlds?

'Did you hear about that young pilot from Earth?

What if I'm not good enough?

What if I never make it?

Why would they be here, in our small village?

I couldn't help but wonder; could this be my chance?

How would I manage to juggle this with all my responsibilities?

But what of my family, my village?

Lost in thought, I ask, 'Gava, do you think there's any truth to the legends of the Earth Sanctuary?

Often mentioned?

Frequently mentioned?

what are the jobs to be done that these tools support?

What other next steps or moves seem worth exploring next to you?

However, perhaps it’s worth another look?

Is this the orange one?

Wait, has that always been there?

And so like, you're sort of making all this progress and like maybe you drop something and it comes back in later, right?

Um, and so, uh, I, I think we can help with some of the stuckness by, um, not being dogmatic about sticking with any one of these things, but at least noticing where, um, when that's happening and saying like, do we need to, um, go wide again?

[00:09:16] Or actually can we, can we stay with, uh, one particular thing?

Is there any other like project level material that you wanna discuss?

Um, You, you often, and I think this is good, like pick your head up and look around and see like, well, if I generalize this, like what's the kind of space this could cover?

Is that if, if we're imagining, like trying to imagine in detail, how will our proposed system help solve a person's problem?

[00:14:59] In the case of the interviews you were trying to extract, like what are the problems people have, what are the strategies people have now?

How do they think about this?

I think you were trying to figure out what should I do next?

Uh, what is seeming most promising?

Uh, where do I feel like I have a path forward?

Where do, where am I feeling most excited?

One of the things you've been doing to your point is very much like what you've been doing with the research log, which is like you're just trying to figure out like day to day, week to week, like, what should I be doing?

How would you categorize that?

Like in like, like for example, one of them was like, okay, what, what are some of the moves that we've taken?

[00:19:01] Matt: or intuitive level, um, what it is like to do these kinds of things?

[00:21:13] Um, what is it that people said?

Let him pass?

Um, do you have a sense of which of those three feels most alive to you?

[00:22:35] When I say 3d, do you, do you know what I'm referred to?

What, what was the word you used?

Did you say it was least clear?

Which one is like jumping out to me?

What?

Like that?

What is that?

Um, now the question is, do we have anything interesting to say about it?

Uh, uh, do we understand it clearly?

Can we articulate it clearly?

Um, so one way to frame this whole problem, I guess a very like, designerly way to frame this is like, uh, how might we apply, uh, large language models to the problem of figuring out what to do next?

Maybe that's it, but then like what specific problem does that cause like when you're trying to do some task, right?

Um, a way that we get around this is by kind of cheating and switching the distillation to like a greedy, almost streaming style operation where, um, you know, he suggests that we find threeish anchors that feel especially salient and then we like fit a line, right?

Um, and then you hold that line in, uh, the, the, your fit in mind, uh, and you keep reading and, uh, now you have only like one chunk that you're holding, so you're only consuming, you know, one of your end slots, right?

Right?

And then you're kind of, you're kind of developing your like hierarchy that way, right?

And then just trying to understand like, why are these related?

What, what are these trying to tell me?

But like a bunch of that is my reaction, you know?

Um, and then there's some theme stuff, right?

It's what have I really figured out?

[00:51:05] Uh, and then what next?

Where are we again?

And again, I'm asking where are we?

Have you seen this exhibit before, by the way?

So, but like, why is that bad?

[00:57:30] Andy: What was the obvious thing that you wanted to do following writing that note?

Um, do you want to do that or you want to keep pushing on this one?

Um, especially if like, I dunno, depending on the algorithms that you use, right?

Why am I feeling not compelled by that?

Can you, like, how does this thing relate to this thing?

Um, I'm reading over this thing, what am I trying to get out of it?

Or I'm doing this thing, what am I trying to get out of it?

Are you, what's, what's going on?

What's going on?

[01:09:05] you know, what, what was actually wrong with what I did in this example that, that I showed you?

Like, what are we saying here?

Are we saying that like, well, I could have gotten this done faster, more easily, that I could have gotten a better answer?

[01:09:23] What are, what are we imagining?

Stopping myself to ask like, um, what problem am I really solving here?

Like, what am I trying to get to?

What would an answer look like?

What is it that I don't like about this answer?

You pull, you pull on that string, um, and you ask like, what problem does that solve?

[01:13:27] Exactly?

How does it solve it?

Why does it solve it?

Like, why was it that previous solutions were insufficient?

[01:13:44] Matt: become even sharper?

What's up?

What was that one thing?

So what, what problem is this solving for you?

Is it like letting you move through the conversation effectively?

I'm, I'm kind of wondering like, something about this felt powerful and like, what was it?

Right?

Um, where was that?

[01:27:52] What does that mean?

Like, what's wrong with the themes that seem bad?

Um, mostly because, um, I think we haven't pinned these things, right?

[01:33:47] If we've been saying, well, okay, what if we're solving this other problem?

Is that okay?

Would you wanna meet here still?

Possible exploration: What if we constrained the agent to only observing actions from one main application (ex: google docs) and focused on observing the actions an expert makes in the process of providing feedback to someone else?

What if the novice acts as both teacher and learner?

Right?

And like, what is that they're like, how has that like?

Had like this cascading set of consequences over time?

And so yeah, how do we help people construct, narrative or change the narrative frames that they're coming from?

Over time?

It's like a second ocean, motion ocean like?

So all of these little what, what am I interested in, right?

Do you remember what you did?

Like, do you remember what you did?

Like do you remember the the solutions the tools that you used in order to like, work through that time last time?

And so yeah, if I think this is kind of similar, because what you're doing is you're taking all of these concepts and like, where's I'm feeling this I'm, oh, I'm starting to, I don't know like maybe maybe when you're depressed right?

So, okay, why don't we hop you back?

Go back to that episode, and have you kind of like, replay some of the moments in that in that episode?

So what do you mean you say Semantic Web?

I'm wondering if there's anything else so like, zoom back out?

But you can do so Okay, so remove the personality but what is good about the artificial agents in her?

Anything important from that example?

Trying to think if there's anything else so the main question is, can you generate questions by trying to generate questions of similar quality to the?

The textbook or is it okay if it generates a different quality or flavor of question?

How will you handle various flavors of incorrect responses?

Where do you go next?

_e.g_., 'Why do you say that?

_e.g_., 'Is this always the case?

_e.g_., 'Why do you say that?

_e.g_., 'What is the counterargument?

_e.g_., 'But if...happened, what else would result?

_e.g_., 'Why do you think that I asked that question?

', 'Why was that question important?

Revealing the issue: 'What evidence supports this idea?

Conceiving reasonable alternatives: 'What might be another explanation or viewpoint of the situation?

Evaluate those consequences: 'What's the effect of thinking or believing this?

If “extended contact" really is the primary goal, what fundamental "nouns" and "verbs” should we build a communications system around?

Where are the powerful ideas about how people learn, feel, and act?

If we designed a new “memory system” with the sole aim of downstream impact on creative work, what would it look like?

What about creativity?

Where do ideas come from?

So: can memory systems make us more insightful?

Presumably some kinds of prompts help here more than others—what characterizes that?

Are special synthes is oriented prompts helpful, or is the impact more a function of solidly understanding the basics?

If we designed a new “memory system” with the sole aim of downstream impact on creative work, what would it look like?

Would it involve retrieval practice at all?

What if it doesn’t include retrieval practice?

What if we relied on some degree of computer supported retrieval to remind us of useful connections and to help us navigate a growing cluster of ideas?

I think one of the essential questions here is how do you create a world?

How do you help someone take a concept they believe is important and flesh out that concept in increasingly rich ways?

Generally you can apply noun verb constructs onto a card in order to apply mental operations on it if “extended contact" really is the primary goal, what fundamental "nouns" and "verbs” should we build a communications system around?

How we can learn to assimilate new representations, concepts, processes and techniques into our capability infrastructure?

How do we usually go about this?

What if we used ideas inspired by spaced repetition?

What is the goal of guided attention?

What is the equivalent in a like steampunk world?

What would be interesting to talk about?

What parts feel most important?

Workspaces have some way to expand and grow if I need more space?

Would that look like an unfolding?
