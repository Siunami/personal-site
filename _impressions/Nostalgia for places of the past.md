This clip was going around recently and left me feeling nostalgic for a life that I had never lived. The world depicted in these scenes had a certain feeling of aliveness. Christopher Alexander, in an attempt to articulate this feeling himself, developed a set of patterns for communicating this feeling. I want to use these patterns as a lense to view this world. 

To start, one of the more prominent features of this world is this castle. Castles have always seemed to carry an allure in society{% sidenote 1 'watch a [medieval architecture historian break down the castle from Harry Potter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r49zkVISluM)' %}. A couple relevant patterns.

(95) Building complex
"A building cannot be a human building unless it is a complex of still smaller buildings or smaller parts which manifest its own internal social facts." By identifying the roles of the parts, a building avoids feeling impersonal.

(98) Circulation realms
"In many modern building complexes, the problem of disorientation is acute. People have no idea where the are and they experience considerable mental stress as a result." Break up a large building into a sequence of realms that can be easily named, each one smaller than the next. Directions can then be given starting with the largest realm, then narrowing down to the most particular address.

(99) Main Building
"A complex of buildings with no center is like a man without a head." "Build the main part of it higher and more prominent than the rest, so that the eye goes immediately to the part which is the most important."

(112) Entrance Transition
"Buildings, and especially houses, with a graceful transition between the street and the inside, are more tranquil than those which open directly off the street." This transition can be marked by a change of light, sound, direction, surface, level. Or by gateways that mark an enclosure.

**Next, this scene of two of the characters having a conversation on one of the castle walls**

Building Edge (Pattern 160)
"Make sure that you treat the edge of the building as a "thing," a "place," a zone with volume to it, not a line or interface which has no thickness. Crenelate the edge of buildings with places that invite people to stop." To sit, lean, and walk, especially at those points along the perimeter which look onto interesting outdoor life.

**Lastly, another conversation taking place on a sunny afternoon on a staircase**

(105) South Facing Outdoors
"People use open space if it is sunny, and do not use it if it isn't"

(133) Staircase as a stage
"A staircase is not just a way of getting from one floor to another. The stair is itself a space, a volume, a part of the building; and unless this space is made to live, it will be a dead spot, and work to disconnect the building and to tear its processes apart."
