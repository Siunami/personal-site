I was laying down watching the sky as the birds and planes passed overhead. And I found myself thinking about a time when people would watch the birds above and dream of taking flight themselves. Movement unburdened by the constraints of geography.

Early attempts at flight tried to mimic the flapping of wings. However, limitations of human muscle power and endurance made producing enough lift difficult. Fixed wing designs also didn't take into account how birds adjust their wing shape during flight to control lift[^2]

It wasn't until we developed a more nuanced understanding of aerodynamics {% sidenote 3 '[Airlerons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileron) developed by the Wright brothers allowed for lateral flight control'%} {% sidenote 4 '[Camber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camber_(aerodynamics)) is an airfoil design that maximizes lift' %} {% sidenote 5 'developing the [coefficient of drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_drag) and the [coefficient of lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_coefficient)' %} and engines that could provide thrust that humans began to take flight.

Now a century later, we find the scientists and engineers of today fascinated with inventing a new type of machine. Intelligent machines. Similar to how early flying machines mimicked birds before understanding the underlying principles of controlled flight, I wonder if we are doing the same thing today. Mimicking human intelligence without understanding the underlying principles governing intelligence. Perhaps deeper understanding would suggest novel approaches to achieving the same means. I'm leaving a few questions here to explore in further detail.

1. Why did humans develop intelligence in the first place? What might this suggest in regards to developing machine intelligence? Two leading hypothesis suggest intelligence developed in response to ecological{% sidenote 7 'complex cognition emerged due to the physical demands of the environment, such as locating and processing food as well as memorising when it would be optimal to eat (i.e. fresh or ripe) (Milton, 1981; Gibson, 1986; Rosati, 2017) via [How intelligent is a cephalopod? Lessons from comparative cognition](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/brv.12651)'%} and social{% sidenote 8 'complex cognition evolved to meet the challenges of living in a complex social group, such as the need to outwit group members through manipulation or deception as a means of achieving higher social success and monopolising more resources including food, shelter, and mates (i.e. Machiavellian intelligence) (Jolly, 1966; Humphrey, 1976; Byrne & Whiten, 1988) via [How intelligent is a cephalopod? Lessons from comparative cognition](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/brv.12651)'%} pressures. [^9]
2. Intelligence is a broad umbrella term for a wide variety of cognitive functions. What are those functions and what do we understand about each of them? Instead of focusing on intelligent machines, what if we got more specific and developed cognitive machines targeting different aspects of intelligence in a serious context of use {% sidenote 10 'See Andy Matuschak on [how effective system design requires insights drawn from serious contexts of use](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z51q8prEJzs5Jqa5WPThYoV?stackedNotes=z3H98n8DGZmu8XArqHZVsckyWvbTe8wK4kAt2&stackedNotes=zs5uUEv9iJH7JuAmsCChxBEMP2zW6CRbiAWE)'%}? ![assets/img/components-of-intelligence.png](assets/img/components-of-intelligence.png){% sidenote 11 'via [How intelligent is a cephalopod? Lessons from comparative cognition](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/brv.12651)'%}

[^9]: The social intelligence hypothesis has been challenged recently because scientists observing octopus have noticed a rather simple social life. Understanding these creatures better may "provide valuable insights into the key characteristics required to support the emergence of complex cognition because they diverged from the vertebrate lineage over 550 million years ago" via [How intelligent is a cephalopod? Lessons from comparative cognition](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/brv.12651)
