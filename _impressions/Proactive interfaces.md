Imagine a future where interfaces anticipated your needs. They could infer your intention based on patterns in your actions. Helping you accomplish these goals by suggesting, supporting and coordinating the various activities in your life.

I remember coming across Jason Yuan's [Mercury](https://www.mercuryos.com/) prototype when I was first getting into interaction design and computers. For me, it was like a north star for what great work in the field looks like; and offered a glimpse into a future with more proactive interfaces.

>Mercury fluidly assembles content and actions based on your intentions. {% sidenote 2  '<video class="table-wrapper" width="320" height="240" controls><source src="https://www.mercuryos.com/static/media/FLOWVid1.875aac5d.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <video class="table-wrapper" width="320" height="240" controls><source src="https://www.mercuryos.com/static/media/MercurySpace.04fa4aaa.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>' %}

One of the showcase examples for Mercury is scheduling a coffee meeting via email. I want to compare the example task above with how I would do the task today. 
- I first come across the email in my inbox. 
- Opening a separate application, I check my calendar, then find the particular date and time to see if that works. 
- I notice that it's pretty close to a meeting that I have afterwards, I open a maps app to check the location of the coffee shop. 
- I want to suggest somewhere closer to my next meeting, so I do another search that overwrites the last one. 
- I want to compare the new search results to the old ones, so I backtrack to the email, get the original location and open the two locations in separate side by side windows.
- Finally, I navigate back to the original email to reply.

A few things that I notice from this flow.
1. There's a lot of movement between different distinct applications.
2. Each application is unaware of my intentions, displaying more information than I need. 
3. It's on me to organize and keep track of things to perform important actions like referencing and comparing.

By bringing the functionality and tools to me when I need them, Mercury improves upon all three of these factors.

Now almost five years since the release of this concept, the technology has caught up to enable interfaces like this {% sidenote 3 'in fact the [spiritual successor](https://new.computer/) to mercury os was released recently' %}. I'm starting to think about them a lot, but that's for a followup post another time.
