Reminds me of a point that Tyler Cowen made in his [Tetragrammaton appearance](https://pca.st/5yk8fc5l) (starting at timestamp 8:50). That today, hardware and software are becoming the same thing; countries will need competence in both in order to succeed in the future. Self-driving vehicles, drones, FPGA chips{% sidenote 1 'An FPGA is a blank slate composed simply of a vast array of transistor logic elements and switches capable of being interconnected via a dense metal wiring stack. via [Pushkar Ranade](https://medium.com/@magicsilicon?source=post_page-----a899d343644--------------------------------)'%}, mobile devices, embedded systems.

It would do any country well to encourage the individuals willing to try. There will be lots of setbacks and learnings. Many flops. Not that different from building pure software applications. This is how we will build future capabilities and know-how.
