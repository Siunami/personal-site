What do I just naturally produce every day? How do I want to live? How do I want to give back to the world?

I find myself always excited to think about interfaces. I almost feel like the very thing that I love to do I've almost written off because it feels frivolous. But I can do this at fractal levels of detail. Come into a product team and just react, react, react to things. I want to train this perception. This raw feeling about the thing. And just trust it. But more so, I want to be able to articulate it on the fly. Immediate reaction, followed by justification given what I've seen. I want to become known for having excellent taste. Rick Rubin is like this. He just knows what he likes. And that isn't easy to do. I want to become the Rick Rubin of interaction design. Able to just see all these fascinating things that people are doing. And to provide them a sort of intellectual, spiritual guidance on their continued self exploration of such thing.

I realize that I like the idea of doing this activity as an exercise. I want to create a folder on my computer and for my website. It'll be a special vault at the core of the website or something. And it'll consist of two obsidian templates that guide me. One for morning pages (personal), one for reactions (public-facing).

I think this is an interesting format. Because it'll create an interesting interface for people to interact with me. I'll do these daily reactions to things that I find and that people send me. They'll be honest, I will simply react. It'll help me train my own capabilities. It'll give me interesting stuff to read, learn, understand.

I'm trying something new this year.

Send me something you think I'll like or that you'd like my reaction to.

Each day, I'll react to a few of them


If it starts to pile up, I'm going to create a mechanism where people can pay to move their thing up to the top of the stack.


I like this idea. I then also want to have the memory map. Because it's a beautiful talking piece like Michael Nielsen has mentioned. I want to put the things that inspire me most in there


I love the way that Tyler Cowen thinks about the activities that he does for free. They're apart of his learning loop. He does these things because they help him do the task, quest and goal that has driven him since he was a young lad. And I realize that in many ways, I wish to model this. That means figuring out an activity that feels like it flows naturally from who you are.

What else?

I guess I feel like there may be an interesting opportunity for me over at Kanjun's company. Because, I think that they haven't started thinking too closely about the interaction design side of this AI problem. And I think that I could potentially come in and really build out this team from scratch. I feel like for me, this would be a fascinating experience.

There's a bunch of things I want to know beforehand though. Generally, have people had a positive experience working with Kanjun in the past.

But then more specifically, what is their long term plan moving forward? What capabilities do they have? And how are they planning to move forward. Why did they take on the kind of money that they did? And what does productization look like, is there a roadmap? What are the pressures that they feel as an organization and externally to find product-market fit? They say helping agent-builders create agents more effectively.

On my end, I see this as opportunity to come into an organization and really help lay the foundations for how we are thinking about the interface design, help flesh out and define any research directions. I'd like to play a role at every stage in the prototyping. Guiding these experiments at ever fractal levels of detail with my taste. I'd like to use my weird network to source an amazing team eventually. To really push the limits and boundaries of what I know and what we, collectively can do.

I know I can build this organization. I know they can use me. I feel excited about that possibility.

Personally, I want to get embedded in an organization, and see how they operate. Better understand the reasoning processes behind a dense collective intelligence. Also, I'd like to build my own capabilities across research, design and engineering. Eventually tacking on another one. Operations (this is the collective intelligence piece).




I had a thought earlier thinking about which part of the brain I would represent in a role like this. It's not raw knowledge. It's partially memory. It's largely something in the executive system. It's this meta-reflection on the activities of an entire organization. And then mapping it to all our goals and honestly reflecting on how it feels. A meta-cognitive role in the company.

Website stuff

I want to be able to rapidly change the view on a folder of documents. It can look just like a link. Or, if I so choose, it can have a more expanded peek mode. That way I can move objects around freely as I so choose.

Reactions also has a secondary effect, requires that you understand the things enough to react to.
