Long term memory, organize and remember knowledge
Context awareness, can prioritize and coordinate pieces of your life
Dynamic interfaces, can shape themselves appropriately to the content to display
Personalization, learns what resonates most with you and incorporates it into its communication
Proactive agency, can source and remind you of information that may be relevant to you
Automations and routines, can perform certain tasks on your behalf or remind you of certain activities you want to partake in
Connecting the dots, dot can recall moments from the past in serendipitous ways helping you weave a narrative around your life.


Linus' project allows making serendipitous connections between information.
- to control and manipulate information in meaningful ways

What are the open questions around this syllabus?

- How well can these systems source interesting connections for me? How?
- I'm curious if I can use questions to guide it to interesting places. 



With Mercury, when you bring all these functionalities and tools into a single space, the amount of movement I need to navigate decreases. This also gives the system more context about the task I am trying to accomplish, allowing the system to display the pieces of information I need to for a task. The horizontal navigation allows for quicker reference and comparison actions between pieces of content.





A few things that I notice from this flow.
1. There's a lot of movement between different distinct applications (in mercury, the applications I need come to me).
2. Each application is unaware of my intentions and displays more information than I need (in mercury, I am shown the information I need with the option to see more)
3. Key actions like referencing, comparing and searching require a lot of manual work to do (in mercury, these modules open next to each other making it easy to see information side by side)

I imagine that these more complex intentions would emerge naturally over time. These spaces may even be suggested by the operating system itself as it notices patterns in your activity. Similar to how it can suggest modules {% sidenote 2 '<video width="320" height="240" controls><source src="https://www.mercuryos.com/static/media/flow2small.23b0cd7b.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>'%} in a single flow.

Goodbye operating system as we know it. The entire experience is designed around intentions and flows. Overall, I think this creates a powerful end-user experience for getting things done. Letting people assemble their own environments custom tailored to their needs. I also like that it would be possible to share flows with each other, taking inspiration from how others do their work. Similar to how it might feel walking into someone's home.

Most interfaces are reactive. They wait for me to do something and then respond. This creates a loop. I decide what I'm going to do; take the action; observe the consequences; reflect; remind myself of my intentions; and repeat. An [OODA Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop). Each step of this loop introduces friction. When the friction is high, I often find my attention wanders away from the activity.
