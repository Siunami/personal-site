In thinking about the future of computing, I've been finding myself returning to attention. Imagine a future where the digital medium doesn't compete for our attention, but instead helps guide it towards the information and activities that are in line with our goals{% sidenote 1 'This is in part what draws me to [[Proactive interfaces]].'%}.

The current state of computing isn't new. Over a half century ago, Herbert Simon made this remarkably poignant observation about our changing relationship to information. "A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention{% sidenote 1 'from *[Designing Organizations For An Information-Rich World](https://samim.io/dl/Designing-Organizations-for-an-Information-Rich-World-Herbert-Simon-1969.pdf)*'%}." We now find ourselves living in the world he foresaw. Media bombards us from every direction. Information accumulates faster than we can make sense of it. Our attention is scattered in digital streams of disconnected ideas. In enabling access to all knowledge, we gave everyone a fire hose instead of a faucet to drink from. 

This isn't meant to discredit access. Access to knowledge can be a great enabler for people. But I've found that for it to have a transformative effect requires time and attention. I have to notice how some new idea or experience makes me feel. I have to consider it in the context of existing beliefs. And if I do this for long enough, on the other end is a clearer sense of what I like and don't like. Along with an assuredness about how I'd like to live this life.

Meditation, journaling, walking in nature, time alone, routines. All of these activities have helped me cultivate attention and will continue to. With the recent shifting tides in AI, I find myself catching glimpses of new environments to nurture this state of mind. Environments that can infer our intents from our actions. Suggest and coordinate activities that can help us move closer to these goals. Filter and distill information that may be relevant to me. Make surprising connections between our past and present selves. All of these mechanisms orchestrating our attention {% sidenote 2 'also relevant are Andys notes on [programmable attention](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Programmable_attention)'%} to support the ways we want to live.

There is more to say but for now, I'll sign off with this quote from Humberto Maturana that captures a sense of the possibilities I see if only we reclaim this precious resource. Humans "are reflective beings that can become aware of the way they live, and of the kind of human beings that they become{% sidenote 3 '*[Metadesign](https://www.pangaro.com/hciiseminar2019/Maturana_Metadesign.pdf)* by Humberto Maturana'%}". If we do this right, perhaps computing will move towards an experience that feels like having a personal compass for cultivating a joyful life.

Changing our relationship with computing towards an experience that feels like having a personal compass for cultivating a joyful life. 

"A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention." - Herbert Simon
- without attention, we relinquish our lives to routine
- this world of hyperstimulus basically just dulls our emotions, nothing can trigger the same spark
- yet it's emotion and attention that allows us to transform, to figure out who we are and what we can become.
- without attention, we cannot inspect this loop of emotions and awareness.
	- Emotions are not something we can directly perturb. 

Perhaps this is the great challenge with living in the world today.

"are reflective beings that can become aware of the way they live, and of the kind of human beings that they become" - Metadesign Humberto Eco

So, since our emotions specify the relational domain in which we are at any instant, it is our emotioning what defines the course of our individual living as well as the course of our cultural history, not our reason.

Attention is important because it is the resource we have that allows for change. Attention given to something provides energy to it, simulated annealing.
Attention can also nurture and grow
- When we give attention to a thing, we are noticing it in its many details.

Attention is **the ability to actively process specific information in the environment while tuning out other details**. Attention is limited in terms of both capacity and duration, so it is important to have ways to effectively manage the attentional resources we have available in order to make sense of the world.

Emotions guide us to a set of relational behaviors.
- When we don't like the emotions we have, we should introspect on them.

Emotions **prepare us for behavior**. When triggered, emotions orchestrate systems such as perception, attention, inference, learning, memory, goal choice, motivational priorities, physiological reactions, motor behaviors, and behavioral decision making (Cosmides & Tooby, 2000; Tooby & Cosmides, 2008).

Spending time in mediums that help us guide this attention to places that we wish to see change.


Emotions can change what we pay attention to.

Attention can trigger emotions

Shifting attention can help us with emotional regulation

Emotional disorders often stem from attention biases.


I have felt this change myself. When I reframe what matters to me. This is an intricate puzzle. You need to find a new center that still considers all the pieces from the previous puzzle.

We are what we attend to. 

A wealth of information, we become schizophrenic. 

https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/attention-spans
First of all, we find in our research a correlation between frequency of attention switching and stress. So the faster the attention switching occurs, stress is measured by people wearing heart rate monitors. We show that stress goes up.

executive function and executive function, you can think of it as the governor of the mind. So it manages things like decision-making, and setting priorities of what we should be paying attention to.
- this can change throughout the day. Sometimes it's higher or lower. Also depends on the type of activity you are engaged in.

We have this incredible resource available to us, and so rather than be upset by it because it distracts us, how can we turn that around and instead find value from it? And how can we utilize our time best and optimize our time best when we use the resources that the internet offers without getting exhausted from it?


What are my questions?

I want to understand the relationship between emotions and attention

I believe that attention can be the source of change in life.



Emotions drive behavior
- When we feel something, we react to it. No one wants to feel pain, we'll behave in ways to reduce that
Attention drives emotions
- What we pay attention to serves as input to our emotions. When we perceive things in certain ways, we will pull different emotions out of it.
- Working memory is emotions
	- 1. By virtue of holding a selected subset of all available representations in memory, WM is by definition a form of attention. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6688548/)
Our intentions are to fulfill our emotions

Behavior
- the actions we take influence what we can perceive

![[Pasted image 20240116185144.png]]
What is eventually perceived by other people is behavior, but underlying behavior is this interplay between emotions and awareness
Attention influences how we feel. Emotions can act as a filter on attention. It is with attention that we have the potential to break out
of emotional loops. It is with attention that we can do things in conflict with how we feel (modulate and change behavior)
Which can effect emotions. We can cause change.

Attention is an important resource because it can catalyze change.




Emotions filter attention
- If we are feeling sad, we are more likely to focus our attention that things that have a similar feeling

Attention influences emotions
- If we are paying attention to the small things in life, that is likely to cascade into how we are feeling

Attention can change behavior 
- We can simply choose to act in a certain way at any moment, even if out of coherence with how we are feeling

Behavior effects emotions
- The ways we act can have downstream effects on emotions
	- Smile
	- Fake it till you make it approach to imposter syndrome
		- This changes our understanding.
			- What happens if I put understanding in the loop?

Emotions influence behavior
- How we feel and how we want to feel affects what we do.


Understanding influence attention
- what we can even perceive in the first place.


A cognitive whiplash.


Attention is a resource that can catalyze change

It allows us to reflect on our behavior and to observe of our emotions. 
What we pay attention to has an effect of on emotions
And emotions, what we want and how we feel, influence how we act on the world.

"A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention." - Herbert Simon

Without it, our behavior becomes fixed on patterns of attention and emotions that we currently have. We have this level of sadness. This level of joy. This level of motivation.
- When we inspect it, we can go deeper. Understanding what parts of it we like and don't like better.
- We can change our behavior in ways to get those things more effectively, or in a different way. 
- We can change out relationship to various emotions.

A future where technologies don't compete for my attention, but instead help guide it towards the information and activities that are in line with my goals.
