In thinking about the future of computing, I've been finding myself returning to attention. Imagine a future where the digital medium doesn't compete for our attention, but instead helps guide it towards the information and activities that are in line with our goals{% sidenote 1 'This is in part what draws me to [[Proactive interfaces]].'%}.

The current state of computing isn't new. Over a half century ago, Herbert Simon made this remarkably poignant observation about our changing relationship to information. "A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention{% sidenote 1 'from *[Designing Organizations For An Information-Rich World](https://samim.io/dl/Designing-Organizations-for-an-Information-Rich-World-Herbert-Simon-1969.pdf)*'%}." We now find ourselves living in the world he foresaw. Media bombards us from every direction. Information accumulates faster than we can make sense of it. Our attention is scattered in digital streams of disconnected ideas. In enabling access to all knowledge, we gave everyone a fire hose instead of a faucet to drink from.

This isn't meant to discredit access. Access to knowledge can be a great enabler for people. But I've found that for it to have a transformative effect requires time and attention. I have to notice how some new idea or experience makes me feel. I have to consider it in the context of existing beliefs. And if I do this for long enough, on the other end is a clearer sense of what I like and don't like. Along with an assuredness about how I'd like to live this life.

Meditation, journaling, walking in nature, time alone, routines. All of these activities have helped me cultivate attention and will continue to. With the recent shifting tides in AI, I find myself catching glimpses of new environments to nurture this state of mind. Environments that can infer our intents from our actions. Suggest and coordinate activities that can help us move closer to these goals. Filter and distill information that may be relevant to me. Make surprising connections between our past and present selves. All of these mechanisms orchestrating our attention {% sidenote 2 'also relevant are Andys notes on [programmable attention](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Programmable_attention)'%} to support the ways we want to live.

There is more to say but for now, I'll sign off with this quote from Humberto Maturana that captures a sense of the possibilities I see if only we reclaim this precious resource. Humans "are reflective beings that can become aware of the way they live, and of the kind of human beings that they become{% sidenote 3 '*[Metadesign](https://www.pangaro.com/hciiseminar2019/Maturana_Metadesign.pdf)* by Humberto Maturana'%}". If we do this right, perhaps computing will feel like having a personal compass orienting us towards a joyful life.
