Values I want to see expressed in the medium of computing

**Focused**

%% In striving to make everything a tap or a swipe away, our intentions can be derailed at any time. A moment of confusion when trying to understand a new idea is relieved by scrolling social media. After checking a notification, you forget the task you were planning to do.

Our computing devices have put us on the path towards hyper-reality. A world of constant background noise where our intentions can be derailed at any time. These undercurrents have not gone unnoticed. Dedicated, singular purpose devices designed for specific tasks offer a possible alternative. Simple tools with clear purposes rather than Swiss army knives. 

Imagine a future workshop filled with computational tools to support different stages of the research and creative process. With a warm cup of tea, you read some research papers on a dedicated tablet â€“ designed with rich affordances for annotation, sensemaking, collaboration and synthesis. When meeting with a collaborator, you gather around an interactive workbench, presenting annotations and works in-progress for discussion, feedback and review. You use a separate device to check and send messages.

**Interpersonal**

The internet has connected the world, but are we really connecting with each other? The social landscape of the internet revolves around masks we construct for others that show them only what we want them to see. There is a place for crafting clear narratives that make your life legible to others. However, life is messy and deep relationships only grow in the soup of life. It's seeing the immediate felt impressions someone has to their environment. The things they like. And their patterns of behavior. These small, frequent interactions over time that let people into the evolving, fractal nature of each other's lives. Shared context builds relationships. 

Our digital footprints give us more opportunities to share context. A friend updating their current list of books with one of your favorites leads you to message them. Spotify's unwrapped letting us easily share our music interests. A question posted by a friend sparks a lively discussion. Seeing a friend's evening runs leads you to start a small running club together. 

**Pro-active**

Orchestrating the activities of life to support long-term goals is not easy. Good habits are hard to build. And the bad ones hard to stop. Remembering the myriad things you want to do later can be hard to keep track of. Our lives unfold across a thousand tiny actions each day that move us closer or farther from who we want to be.

Computers are in a unique position to support us here. It can use the context it has about your daily activities, work and goals to help you reflect on different aspects of life. As you find more clarity, it can help you coordinate activities that move you towards the things you want. Imagine an inbox but instead of messages, it's an evolving list of activities for you to do next. 
- Write a reflection on that question you wrote down two days ago. 
- Send a message to a friend you haven't interacted with in a while. 
- Do some research on this organization you were thinking of reaching out to for work. 
- React to that idea from last week, does it still resonate now?
- You mentioned feeling unmotivated about your project, maybe re-reading this snippet of writing that you wrote at the start of the project might remind you of the spark that first inspired you.

**Fluid**

(I think this one is important, but it isn't really relevant until you are at end game. Or I think if you're ability to do it with craft is high.)

The physical world has a spatial consistency to it. An object can move in and out of view. Accelerate.

So much of our software is one size fits all
