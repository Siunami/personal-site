				<p>
					Sometimes I like to imagine the mind as a lake. When there are no
					disturbances, the lake is still. We can peer into the water, and see
					our motivations clearly.
				</p>

				<p>
					But life is indifferent to this sanctuary. Disturbances will distort
					its surface. And when we lose the ability to see clearly, our actions
					can lead to self-destruction.
				</p>

				<p>
					I often find myself staring out at the city; feeling overwhelmed by
					the sheer number of people engaged in a world their own. Each of us
					facing our own internal struggles to live a life that is authentic to
					us. In this messy soup of existence, we sometimes forget who we are.
				</p>

				<p>
					I want to build tools that
					<em>help people tell the stories of their lives</em>. So that they can
					carry this story with them, and share it with the people around them.
					So that it can nourish and remind them of who they are when they are
					lost. Our world is shaped by beautiful dreams; may ten thousand more
					bloom.
