Tossing them above the bar with a slight tilt makes it feel lighter, less formal, less at stake and benefits the feeling of remixing something<br/><br/>Also the way they introduce the video descriptions of pan actions after a short delay. Enough time that a familiar user won't see the tutorial, but someone who is hovering over it confused will almost immediately see it."
