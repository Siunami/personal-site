- bulletin: So often, the things I make that resonate the most for others are the ones that emerge from a pretty loose state of play. There's usually not a large overarching objective, but rather some feeling I want to capture. Often discovery. Or exploration. The process for getting there often feels similar to shaping clay. I know the general form, but many of the details fall out of the sculpting process itself.
